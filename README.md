# Seedbox

A collection of Dockerfiles and a docker-compose configuration to set up a
seedbox and personal media server.

-----------------------|----------------------------|
| Plex                 | plex.yourdomain.com        |

| Sonarr               | sonarr.yourdomain.com      |
| Radarr               | radarr.yourdomain.com      |
| Bazarr               | bazarr.yourdomain.com      |
| Jackett              | jackett.yourdomain.com     |
| JDownloader          | jdownloader.yourdomain.com |
| Tautulli (plexPy)    | tautulli.yourdomain.com    |
| NextCloud            | nextcloud.yourdomain.com   |
| Portainer            | portainer.yourdomain.com   |

| Duplicati            | duplicati.yourdomain.com   |

The front-end reverse proxy (Traefik) routes based on the lowest level subdomain (e.g.
`deluge.example.com` would route to deluge). Since this is how the router
works, it is recommended for you to get a top level domain. If you do not have
one, you can edit your domains locally by changing your hosts file or use a
browser plugin that changes the host header.

Traefik takes care of valid Let's Encrypt certificates and auto-renewal.

Note: Plex is also available directly through the `32400` port without going
through the reverse proxy.

## Dependencies

- [Docker](https://github.com/docker/docker) >= 1.13.0
    + Install guidelines for Ubuntu 16.04: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-16-04
- [Docker Compose](https://github.com/docker/compose) >=v1.10.0
    + Install guidelines for Ubuntu 16.04: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-docker-compose-on-ubuntu-16-04
- [local-persist Docker plugin](https://github.com/CWSpear/local-persist): installed directly on host (not in container). This is a volume plugin that extends the default local driverâ€™s functionality by allowing you specify a mountpoint anywhere on the host, which enables the files to always persist, even if the volume is removed via `docker volume rm. Use *systemd* install for Ubuntu 16.04.

## Configuration

Before running, please create the volumes which will be statically mapped to the ones on the host:

```sh
sudo su -c "mkdir /data && mkdir /data/config && mkdir /data/torrents""
./init.sh
```

Edit the `.env` file and change the variables as desired.
The variables are all self-explanatory.
Sames goes for `open-tunnel.sh` script to open a tunnel with port forwarding in order to access Plex Tools directly in your browser. (documentation needs to be updated - for now just install manually Plex Tools)

## Running & updating

```sh
./update-all.sh
```

docker-compose should manage all the volumes and network setup for you. If it
does not, verify that your docker and docker-compose version is updated.

Make sure you install the dependencies and finish configuration before doing
this.

## PlexPass

Just set the `VERSION` environment variable to `latest` on the Plex service (enabled by default).
See https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/plex.

## Where is my data?

All data is saved in the docker volumes `seedbox_config` or
`seedbox_torrents`.
These volumes are mapped to the `config` and `torrents` folders located in `/data` on the host. You can change these static paths in the docker-compose.yml file.
Thanks to the **local-persist** Docker plugin, the data located in these volumes is persistent, meaning that volumes are not deleted, even when using the ```docker-compose down``` command. It would be a shame to loose everything by running a simple docker command ;-)
